![](./screenshot.png)

## Development setup

Just clone this repo into your apps directory ([Nextcloud server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server#running-master-checkouts) installation needed). Additionally, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) are needed for installing JavaScript dependencies and building the frontend code.

Once npm and Node.js are installed, this can be done by running:
```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Installation

### Server

You will need an working on-premise Office Online server which has added the Nextcloud server as a trusted host for WOPI. The cloud-based Office 365 is not supported.
